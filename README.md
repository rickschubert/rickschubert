### Passionate about automating the world

My main programming languages are Golang and JavaScript/TypeScript, but I have also dabbled in many others over the years.

I recently also launched an online course on Automated Web Testing with JavaScript and Playwright - [you can check it out here](https://www.udemy.com/course/automated-web-testing/?referralCode=A24D5BD518B4CDBF1BFD)!
