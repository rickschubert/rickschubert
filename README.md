### Deeply passionate about automating processes.

:robot: - Expert in test automation

- Browser automation (WebdriverIO, Selenium, Cypress)
- Headless automation with custom scripts

:whale: - Docker

:penguin: - Linux/UNIX

:bellhop_bell: - Continuous Integration (CI/CD) with Jenkins/CircleCI etc.

My main programming language is JavaScript/TypeScript, but I have also dabbled in many others over the years. My newest passion is the Go programming language which I wish to use more in the feature.

Outside of programming, I am also a writer who recently finished a stage play.
